# Dozer
Dozer is a bot for [Discord](https://discordapp.com/), a popular messaging application. It runs on the Java library [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA).

Dozer currently runs on three servers:
- Rolla FTC
- 6817 - 10 Factorial (Rolla FRC)
- Meme-Central (personal among friends)

Dozer inherits its name from a particular robot from [FIRST](https://www.firstinspires.org/) game reveals. FIRST is a non-profit organization that stresses the importance of STEM and Gracious Professionalism. To learn more about FIRST, click [here](https://www.firstinspires.org/about/vision-and-mission).

## Functionality

Dozer is currently a small bot used as a means to convey inside jokes- however, I plan to later give Dozer more utility commands and more administrative commands. Dozer is an ongoing project, and I hope to build it over time.


## Usage

The main reason Dozer is available on GitHub is so that I can quickly transfer work between computers. However, you are free to use Dozer however you wish, including using and modifying. Credit is appreciated but not required.

Dozer's project files are organized using Maven, and the project is designed to be used in [JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). To run Dozer, build and run as you would with any other project. 


## Changelog

Journey with me as I build Dozer! All changes are marked in [changelog.md](https://github.com/FusionForScience/DozerDiscord/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
